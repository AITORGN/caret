`rfe_lda`
===== 

There are regression tests to compare model results between different versions of `caret` and the individual packages. These test evaluate whether consistent results can be obtained. The code used to generate the objects that are compared can be found [here](https://github.com/topepo/caret/blob/master/RegressionTests/Code/rfe_lda.R).
A [history of commits](https://github.com/topepo/caret/commits/master/models/files/rfe_lda.R) for the model code is also available
