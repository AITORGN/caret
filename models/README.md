`RegressionTests` directory
=========


These files are used to do regression testing between versions of the package. 

The `move_files.R` file will use the current date and `caret` version to create a separate testing directory.

The `Code` directory contains files for each model that generate R objects that are contrasted between models.

`compare.R` will compare the model objects between two testing directories generated by `move_files.R`.
